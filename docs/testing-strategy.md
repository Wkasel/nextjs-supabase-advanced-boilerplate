# Recovery Machine - Comprehensive Testing Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the Recovery Machine application, focusing on critical business flows including booking, payment processing, and user experience across all devices.

## Testing Framework Overview

### Test Pyramid Implementation

```
       /\
      /E2E\      <- High-value user journeys (Playwright)
     /------\
    /Integr. \   <- API and component integration
   /----------\
  /   Unit     \ <- Business logic and components (Jest + RTL)
 /--------------\
```

## 1. Unit Testing Strategy

### Framework: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Coverage Target**: 90% overall, 100% for critical paths
- **Focus Areas**: Business logic, form validation, component behavior
- **Test Environment**: jsdom with Next.js testing setup

### Critical Components to Test

#### 1.1 Authentication & User Management
```typescript
// Components: GoogleSignInButton, sign-in/sign-up forms
- User registration validation
- Login/logout flows
- Session management
- Error state handling
```

#### 1.2 Booking Flow Components
```typescript
// Core booking logic (to be implemented)
- Service selection validation
- Date/time picker logic
- Availability checking
- Form validation and error states
- Booking confirmation flow
```

#### 1.3 Payment Integration
```typescript
// Bolt payment integration

- Payment state management
- Error handling and retry logic
```

#### 1.4 UI Components
```typescript
// Existing UI components
- Hero component rendering
- Form components (FormBuilder)
- Navigation components
- Error boundary components
```

### Test Data Strategy
- **Fixtures**: Standardized test data for consistent testing
- **Factories**: Dynamic test data generation
- **Mocks**: API responses and external service integration

## 2. End-to-End Testing Strategy

### Framework: Playwright
- **Browser Coverage**: Chromium, Firefox, Safari
- **Device Testing**: Desktop, tablet, mobile viewports
- **Test Environment**: Staging environment with real integrations

### Critical E2E Scenarios

#### 2.1 Complete Booking Journey
```gherkin
Feature: Complete Booking Flow
  Scenario: Successful weekly subscription booking
    Given user is on the homepage
    When user clicks "Book Now"
    And selects weekly cold plunge service
    And chooses available time slot
    And enters delivery address
    And completes payment with Bolt
    Then booking confirmation is displayed
    And user receives confirmation email
    And booking appears in user dashboard
```

#### 2.2 Payment Processing Scenarios
```gherkin
Feature: Payment Integration
  Scenario: Successful Bolt payment
    Given user has items in booking cart
    When user proceeds to checkout
    And enters valid payment information
    And clicks "Complete Payment"
    Then payment is processed successfully
    And user receives payment confirmation

  Scenario: Failed payment handling
    Given user attempts checkout with invalid card
    When payment processing fails
    Then appropriate error message is displayed
    And user can retry with different payment method
```

#### 2.3 Mobile User Experience
```gherkin
Feature: Mobile Booking Experience
  Scenario: Mobile booking flow
    Given user is on mobile device
    When user navigates through booking flow
    Then all interactions work with touch gestures
    And forms are mobile-optimized
    And payment flow works on mobile
```

## 3. Mobile Testing Protocols

### Responsive Design Testing
- **Viewport Ranges**: 320px - 1920px width
- **Device Simulation**: iPhone, Android, iPad
- **Orientation Testing**: Portrait and landscape modes

### Touch Interaction Testing

- **Touch Target Size**: Minimum 44px x 44px
- **Scrolling Behavior**: Smooth scrolling, momentum
- **Form Interactions**: Input focus, keyboard handling

### Mobile Performance Testing
- **Network Conditions**: 3G, 4G, WiFi simulation
- **Device Capabilities**: CPU throttling, memory constraints
- **Battery Impact**: Performance under low battery conditions

## 4. Payment Testing with Bolt Sandbox

### Test Environment Setup
```javascript
// Bolt sandbox configuration

  publishableKey: process.env.BOLT_SANDBOX_KEY,
  environment: 'sandbox',
  testMode: true
};
```

### Payment Scenarios
1. **Successful Payments**
   - Credit card (Visa, MasterCard, Amex)
   - Digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay)
   - Buy now, pay later options

2. **Failure Scenarios**
   - Declined cards
   - Network timeouts
   - 3DS authentication failures
   - Insufficient funds

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Partial payments
   - Refund processing
   - Currency conversion
   - Subscription billing

### Test Data
```javascript
// Bolt test cards
const testCards = {
  success: '4111 1111 1111 1111',
  decline: '4000 0000 0000 0002',
  timeout: '4000 0000 0000 0010'
};
```

## 5. Accessibility Testing (WCAG 2.1 AA)
